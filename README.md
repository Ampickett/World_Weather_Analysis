# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this is to show weather descriptions and weather data. Customers are able to input their ideal outdoor temperature, which can be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. We have created a travel itinerary, travel map, and a marker layer map.


We are able to display the hotels along with the current weather:
